If you haven't already, first complete the Enumerable Exercises Repo: https://github.com/turingschool/enums-exercises. The Enumerable Exercises Repo will help you learn about all the important enumerables and how they work. After you are familiar with several enumerables, the exercises in this folder will help you work on your problem solving with enumerables. You will need to select which enumerable will best fit the problem.

For the `enumerables_one_test`, you will only need `map`, `find`, and `find_all` to complete the tasks.

For `enumerables_exercises_test`, you will need to consider all enumerables and pick which one will be the best choice.
